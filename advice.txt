So How Long Should You Stand at Work?
Given that everyone’s physiology is different, the exact right ratio of sitting to standing will differ from person to person. Many ergonomic experts recommend standing about 5-15 minutes out of every hour when using a standing desk, although research is ongoing. One study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine recommends that it’s ideal to move, stand, and take breaks from sitting for a total of at least 2 hours in an 8 hour work day. And working up to standing, walking, and moving for half of an 8 hour work day may increase the benefits.
